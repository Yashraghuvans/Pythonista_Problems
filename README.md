# Pythonista_Problems

This repository serves as a collection of my Python solutions to coding challenges from platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank. It's a place to showcase my learning, problem-solving skills, and understanding of data structures and algorithms.

## Purpose:

Document my progress: Track my journey as I learn Python and improve my coding abilities.
Share solutions: Provide potential solutions to others who may be working on similar problems.
Learn from feedback: Invite contributions, suggestions, and improvements from the community.
Structure:

The repository is organized into subfolders based on the problem-solving platform:
1. leetcode : Contains solutions to LeetCode problems.
2. hackerrank : Contains solutions to HackerRank challenges.

Each subfolder will have separate folders for different categories (e.g., "arrays," "linked lists," "graphs") if applicable. Within these folders, each problem will have its own directory with a Python file (.py) containing the solution code.
